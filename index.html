    In essence, the evolution of engines has significantly progressed the way society runs. From public transport to utilising vehicles for transportation of goods, one can say engines are vital to our lifestyles. This project examines how these engines have emerged and established themselves. Over time, these engines have developed in their functionalities and their mechanisms and this will also be discussed within this report. This project also mentions any important figures who have contributed to advancements within the automotive industry. Whilst there is appreciation for the variety of engines available, the aim of this article is to cover steam, internal combustion, electric and hydrogen engines as the four key types of engines. Their role in todayâ€™s day and age is explored and their possible implications. Furthermore, engines are constantly evolving so another objective of this article would be to outline future innovations for automotive engines.
