  <p class="ex1">
    In essence, the evolution of engines has significantly progressed the way society runs. From public transport to utilising vehicles for transportation of goods, one can say engines are vital to our lifestyles. This project examines how these engines have emerged and established themselves. Over time, these engines have developed in their functionalities and their mechanisms and this will also be discussed within this report. This project also mentions any important figures who have contributed to advancements within the automotive industry. Whilst there is appreciation for the variety of engines available, the aim of this article is to cover steam, internal combustion, electric and hydrogen engines as the four key types of engines. Their role in today’s day and age is explored and their possible implications. Furthermore, engines are constantly evolving so another objective of this article would be to outline future innovations for automotive engines.

  <h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>

  <p class="ex1">
    Automotive engines are an integral part of our day to day lives. Globally, 85.4 million motor vehicles were produced in 2022 (1). In the UK, in fact, 74% of English residents aged 17 or over have a full driving license which is around 34.25 million people (2). As the number of drivers per year continues to rise, so does car production which has meant engines are constantly evolving. This project aims to focus on different types of engines, how they have improved, and their uses in today’s era. There is also an aim to outline the mechanisms of these engines to provide an insight and delve deeper into the internal contraptions.  The methodology of this project is to analyse reliable sources including peer-reviewed journal articles and resources from well-established organisations to ensure the validity of this article is optimal.
